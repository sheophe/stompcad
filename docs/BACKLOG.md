# Backlog

Current work that is agreed or recorded but not scheduled.

## Paired redundancy review

**Status:** Agreed, not started.

**Constraint:** Claude and Codex review the source together, preserving behaviour and
public interfaces. Target about a 15% reduction in source lines through consolidation,
especially repeated drawing, formatting, parsing, and test helpers. Architectural
rationale belongs in ADRs; source reduction must not remove required documentation or
features.

**Acceptance:** The source is about 15% smaller with no loss of function. The full suite
passes, and targeted mutation checks demonstrate that each refactor preserved behaviour.

## Adopt mypy `strict` on `src/aidrill`

**Status:** Agreed, not started.

**Constraint:** Annotate one module at a time and keep the type gate green throughout.
`Pipeline.__getitem__` needs overloads for `int` and `slice`; enable `strict` only after
the implementation is clean. Keep each module's typing change in its own commit.

**Acceptance:** `strict = true` is enabled for `src/aidrill`, `mypy src/aidrill` reports no
errors, and the test suite passes.

## Measure and, if necessary, reduce package import cost

**Status:** Noted; no implementation agreed.

**Constraint:** `import aidrill` currently imports `pikepdf` because the package root
exports `AiPdfSource`. Do not introduce lazy loading without evidence that this cost is
material. If measurement justifies a change, preserve the root import contract and keep
`__all__`, `dir()`, and attribute access consistent.

**Acceptance:** A reproducible benchmark closes the item if the cost is immaterial. If the
cost is material, the implemented change demonstrates an improvement, avoids eager
`pikepdf` loading, preserves `AiPdfSource` at the package root, and passes the full suite.

## Cover every chain-dimension segment

**Status:** Confirmed gap, not scheduled.

**Constraint:** Exercise a row with at least three holes so omitting the first or last
consecutive pair cannot pass accidentally.

**Acceptance:** The test checks that each row has `len(stations) - 1` `dim-line` elements,
and a mutation that skips the first pair fails that test.
